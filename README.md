# Halleyx-Coding-Challenge

Web page designer
Objective:
The intent of the challenge is to build a visual web page designer. This designer should allow
users to build and publish web pages using the designer. The published web pages should be
accessible in the browser by the user
Description:
The web designer should have a toolbox with the following
● Layout
● Label
● Button
● Text box
● Dropdown
● Check box
● Radio button
● Table
● Navigation link
● Image
Important:
Design view
1. The user should be able to define the layout using the layout element (e.g. when the
user click layout the design mode should allow the user to define columns and rows,
merged columns and rows in order to achieve the required design layout)
2. The user should be able to drag and drop the UI elements from the toolbar into the
content area on the right-hand side
3. The settings icon shows up when the user hover over the element. Users can click on
the setting icon to open a modal window to define settings for each element defined
using designer
4. Every element created using the designer should have a name and a unique id for the
element. Use the settings icon to define the name and ID
5. For label elements the user should be able to define the font size, font style (Bold, Italic,
Underline) and Color. Use the settings icon to define these settings
6. For Dropdown, Radio button, Checkbox allow user to define the value list (i.e. A
dropdown to show a list of days (Monday to Sunday)). Use the setting icon to define the
values list and default value
7. For tables, allow the user to define the number of columns. For each column the user
should be able to define the header name. Also allow users to define the table data (e.g.
Halleyx Confidential. For office use only.
Data source for table from a JSON file or CSV file). Use the setting icons to configure
table properties
8. For both button and navigation links, the user should be able to define the action (e.g.
When the user clicks the button or link redirect to another page or save entered data to
file on the web page). Use the settings icon to define the name, id and action properties
9. Users should be able define image control with height and width, upload images as well.
Use the setting icon upload the image and define size of the image
Preview
- User should be able to click preview to view the output of the designed page in a
separate tab on the browser
- Designed web pages needs to be responsive (i.e. Deployed pages should be rendering
properly in Mobile, Tablet or Desktop views)
Publish
- Users should be able to publish the design. This action should create a new web page
and store it in a file. The user should be able to open the file it should show the
elements as per the design
- Ideally the new page should be deployed to a web server and user should have a URL to
access the page in the browser
